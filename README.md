#School Project - 2d Game In Java
The purpose of this project was to study the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. At the same time, building a well-playable and thought-out game in Java. The emphasis of the project was mainly focused on the thorough understanding of OOP basics like “APIE”, “DRY”, “SOLID” as well as design patterns. A big chunk of time was also spent on building the game based on MVC pattern, which was tailored for video games, using linear algebra and math for all sorts of animations. No frameworks were provided for the project, except for some standard libraries in Java. Instead, all students had to write all code from scratch. 

Upon finishing this class, I continued improving the project. I proceeded with refactoring and adding new features to the logic of the game including new characters and interaction. The next step for this project would be to start writing a physics engine to support the appropriate behavior of objects on the screen when different forces are taken into consideration. 

The following concept were thoroughly covered in the project: sdfsdfxcvwe
	OOP, APIE, DRY, SOLID, Command DP, Strategy DP, MVC DP, Iterator DP, Adapter DP, Composite DP, Factor Method DP, Observer DP, Proxy DP, Singleton DP, Affine Transformations, Java Optionals, Java Functional Programming.
